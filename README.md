What is this?
-------------

This is intended as a gentle introduction to TDD/BDD for people who have not
experienced it before. We all know what a stack does, so let's focus on the
running tests and letting those tests drive the implementation.

Instructions
------------

* Fork this project and clone it locally
* Open up spec/stack_spec.rb
* Run `bundle`
* Run `bundle exec rspec --color spec/stack_spec.rb`
* Make tests pass
* Refactor
